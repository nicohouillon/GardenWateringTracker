## Project Structure

```
garden-watering-tracker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code.js           # Google Apps Script backend code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html        # Frontend web interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # This file
```

### Key Functions

**Backend (code.js)**:
- `doGet()` - Serves the HTML interface
- `doPost()` - Handles API requests from frontend
- `addWateringRecord()` - Adds/updates watering records
- `getWateringRecords()` - Fetches records for a specific week
- `deleteWateringRecord()` - Removes records
- `sendWateringNotification()` - Sends email alerts

**Frontend (index.html)**:
- Responsive form interface
- Week-by-week record browsing
- Real-time data synchronization
- Mobile-optimized design

## Data Storage

Records are stored in Google Sheets with the following columns:
- **Date**: Date of watering activity
- **Gardener**: Name of person who watered (or didn't water)
- **Watered**: Boolean indicating if watering occurred
- **Notes**: Optional text notes
- **Timestamp**: When the record was created/updated

## Timezone Handling

The application handles timezones carefully to ensure dates display consistently:
- Frontend sends dates as ISO strings (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Backend normalizes dates to UTC for consistent storage
- Display formatting respects local timezone settings
- Email notifications use local date formatting

## Customization

### Changing Email Template

Edit the `sendWateringNotification()` function in `code.js` to customize:
- Email subject line
- HTML email body
- Sender display name

### Styling

Modify the `<style>` section in `index.html` to change:
- Colors and themes
- Layout and spacing
- Mobile responsiveness
- Typography

### Adding Fields

To add new data fields:
1. Update the HTML form in `index.html`
2. Modify the `addWateringRecord()` function in `code.js`
3. Update the display logic in `handleGetRecordsSuccess()`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Could not open spreadsheet" error**:
- Verify the `SPREADSHEET_ID` is correct
- Ensure the Apps Script has permission to access the sheet

**Emails not sending**:
- Check that Gmail API is enabled
- Verify email addresses in `GARDENER_EMAILS` are valid JSON
- Ensure Gmail permissions are granted

**Records not displaying**:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify the web app deployment is accessible
- Ensure Apps Script execution permissions are granted

**Timezone issues**:
- The recent fix in `sendWateringNotification()` should resolve date display issues
- Ensure your Apps Script project timezone matches your location

### Debug Mode

Uncomment the test connection button in `index.html` to verify:
- Apps Script connectivity
- Spreadsheet access
- Data retrieval
